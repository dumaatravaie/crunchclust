Crunchclust is an efficient clustering algorithm that is capable of handling the most common Roche's 454 sequencing error ( Homopolymers ). It uses Levenshtein distance for sequence comparison during clustering. It is also used successfully for the clustering of Illumina Miseq sequences. The software is being developed by Dipankar Bachar and Prof. Richard Christen.
